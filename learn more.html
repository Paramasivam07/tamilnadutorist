        <p class="p3">The History of Tamil Nadu dates back to 6000 years. It can be broadly divided into Ancient, Medieval and Modern Tamil Nadu. Many of the historians believe in the theory of the Aryan invasion in the South. The Tamils belonging to the Dravidian race had to move further South due to the invasion by the Aryans.</p>

        <p class="p3">The history of the area dates back to more than two thousand years ago. Tamil Nadu was originally known as Tamilham and the proof of the Tamilham settlements are clear with the existence of ancient ports like Karipattinam, Arikamedu and Korkai. The birth place of Dravidian culture has witnessed several great dynasties. The Pallavas ruled in the 4th century A.D. The Cholas ruled between 1st and 4th centuries. They rose to power again in the 9th century, only to be replaced by the Pandyas in the 14th century. The East India Company started their factory in 1640 at Madras. They fought with the Dutch and the French to establish their supremacy. Tamil Nadu has contributed a lot in the country's struggle for freedom. After India's Independence, the state of Madras came into existence and 1968, the name was changed to Tamil Nadu.</p>
